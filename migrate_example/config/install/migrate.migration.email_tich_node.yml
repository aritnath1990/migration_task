   # Some Drupal fields may have multiple components we may want to set
  # separately. For example, text fields may have summaries (teasers) in
  # addition to the full text value. We use / to separate the field name from
  # the internal field value being set, and put it in quotes because / is a
  # YAML special character.

# Our beer nodes have references to terms and users, so we want those to be
# imported first. We make that dependency explicit here - by putting those
# migrations under the 'required' key, we ensure that the tools will prevent
# us from running the beer_node migration unless the beer_term and beer_user
# migrations are complete (although we can override the dependency check by
# passing --force to the drush migrate-import command). We can also add
# 'optional' dependencies - these affect the order in which migrations are
# displayed, and run by default, but does not force you run them in that
# order.
# The general rule of thumb is that any migrations referenced by migration
# process plugins should be required here.
